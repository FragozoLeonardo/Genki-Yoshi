# GenkiYoshi

**GenkiYoshi** is a Ruby CLI application that generates customizable Japanese manuscript paper (ÂéüÁ®øÁî®Á¥ô) for writing practice. The application now features a modular OOP architecture following SOLID principles, comprehensive test coverage, and improved maintainability.

## Features
- **Custom Character Sheets**: Generate ÂéüÁ®øÁî®Á¥ô sheets with kana and kanji pre-filled in each cell
- **Blank Character Sheets**: Generate only the blank grid for freehand writing practice
- **Customizable Colors**: Choose custom colors for grid lines, example characters, and practice characters
- **Multiple Character Sets**: Input up to three sets of characters for varied practice
- **UTF-8 Support**: Full support for Japanese characters and combinations
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable code following SOLID principles

## Architecture Overview

GenkiYoshi now follows a modular Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) architecture with separation of concerns:

### Core Components

- **CLI**: Handles user interaction and workflow coordination
- **PDFGenerator**: Manages PDF creation and generation
- **GridDrawer**: Responsible for drawing grid cells and characters
- **CharacterProcessor**: Processes and validates character input
- **Settings**: Manages application configuration and preferences
- **TemporaryFileManager**: Handles file operations and conversions

### Design Principles

- **SOLID Compliance**: Each class has a single responsibility
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive RSpec test suite
- **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling between components
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and user feedback

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.7+ (recommended 3.0+)
- Poppler-utils for PDF processing
- Japanese font support (optional, for better rendering)

### Step 1: Install Ruby

#### Windows
1. Download the Ruby Installer from [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/)
2. Run the installer and ensure you select the option to add Ruby to your system's PATH

#### MacOS
```bash
brew install ruby
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt install ruby-full
```

### Step 2: Install Poppler-Utils

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

#### MacOS
```bash
brew install poppler
```

#### Windows
1. Download the latest poppler release for Windows from [poppler releases](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/)
2. Extract the downloaded file
3. Add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable

### Step 3: Install GenkiYoshi

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FragozoLeonardo/Genki-Yoshi.git
cd Genki-Yoshi
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
bundle install
```

3. (Optional) Install Japanese fonts for better character rendering:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install fonts-ipafont fonts-noto-cjk

# MacOS
brew install --cask font-noto-sans-cjk-jp
```

## Usage

Run the application with:
```bash
./genki-yoshi
```

Or using Ruby directly:
```bash
ruby -I lib lib/genki_yoshi/cli.rb
```

The interactive CLI will guide you through:
1. Color customization for grid lines and characters
2. Character input (up to three sets)
3. Output filename selection
4. Confirmation before generation

[Here](https://youtu.be/FeBbXmcPcR0) is a short YouTube tutorial on how to use the CLI.

## Running Tests

GenkiYoshi includes a comprehensive test suite using RSpec. To run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific test files
bundle exec rspec spec/pdf_generator_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/grid_drawer_spec.rb

# Run with detailed output
bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```

The test suite covers:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for workflow validation
- Error handling and edge cases
- Mocking of external dependencies
