# GenkiYoshi

**GenkiYoshi** is a Ruby program to generate åŽŸç¨¿ç”¨ç´™ sheet(s) (Japanese manuscript paper) in two different "flavors": one with to-be-filled kanji and/or kana, and another with just the blank grid. This tool is great for practicing Japanese writing, whether it's kanji, kana, or mixed text.

## Usage
Once Ruby is installed and the repository is cloned, you can start generating your åŽŸç¨¿ç”¨ç´™ sheet(s).

### Character Sheets
To generate a åŽŸç¨¿ç”¨ç´™ sheet(s) filled with kanji and kana characters:
1. Open the `kanji_sheets.rb` file.
2. In the file, you will see some arrays. This is where you will input the characters you want to appear on the sheet: Example:
   ```ruby
   kanji = %w[æ—¥æœ¬èªžå­¦ç¿’]
   ```
3. Run the script in your terminal:
   ```bash
   ruby kanji_sheets.rb
   ```
This will generate an A4-size åŽŸç¨¿ç”¨ç´™ sheet(s) with the characters you specified in each cell.

### Blank Character Sheets
If you want to generate a blank grid for freehand practice:
1. Open the `kanji_sheets_blank.rb` file.
2. Simply run the script:
   ```bash
   ruby kanji_sheets_blank.rb
   ```
This will generate a blank A4-sized åŽŸç¨¿ç”¨ç´™ sheet(s) for manual writing.
