# GenkiYoshi

**GenkiYoshi** is a Ruby program to generate åŽŸç¨¿ç”¨ç´™ sheet(s) (Japanese manuscript paper) in two different "flavors": one with to-be-filled kanji and/or kana, and another with just the blank grid. This tool is great for practicing Japanese writing, whether it's kanji, kana, or mixed text.
